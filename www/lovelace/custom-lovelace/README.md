## FAQ

### I have added the custom card javascript file in my `www` folder, but it doesn't load, why?
If this was the first time you created the `www` folder in your `config` than you MUST restart Home Assistant.

### I get a error with `n.setConfig' is undefied`, how do i fix this?
This is usually caused by running an older frontend. If you're already running 0.73 or newer please make sure you  have cleared browser cache. On mobile app you can also force a few refreshes. If you're running IOS device check next question.

### Custom components don't load on my IOS device?
This is because for IOS devices by default javascript served is `es5`. You can allow custom components to load by forcing `javascript_version: latest` in your `configuration.yaml` under `frontend:`. 

> Note: Enabling `latest` on IOS could cause automation and script editor to crash.

### I am running Firefox but custom cards like gauge-card look bad or don't load at all. How do I fix this?

This is probably because your version of Firefox doesn't have custom components supported or enabled. Please set to `true` in your `about:config` the following settings: `dom.webcomponents.customelements.enabled` and `dom.webcomponents.shadowdom.enabled`

### I followed all steps to add custom component but I see javascript errors in my browser. What happend?

It dependso on the errors. 

1. For the following errors:
  - `Cannot call a class constructor without |new|`
  - `Class constructor BigNumberCard cannot be invoked without 'new'`

Please make sure you have `javascript_version: latest` in your `configuration.yaml` under `frontend:`.

2. For the following errors:
  - `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <`

This is most likely because you downloaded the [html](https://github.com/ciotlosm/custom-lovelace/blob/master/gauge-card/gauge-card.js) from gitbut instead of [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ciotlosm/custom-lovelace/master/gauge-card/gauge-card.js). That is not valid javascript. Always make sure you download using `raw` button. After downloading the file again with the 'raw' button, remember to bump the version number for the custom component speficied in the 'resources' of your lovelace-ui.yaml file.

3. For the following errors:
  - `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`

You probably are using `thermostat-card` and didn't specify `module` for `type` in `resources`

```yaml
  - url: /local/custom-lovelace/thermostat-card/thermostat-card.js?v=0.1
    type: module
```
